            <h1><b>THE ORIGIN</b></h1>
            <div class="post">
             <p class="post">Ipoh is located in the heart of the Kinta Valley, an area rich in tin mining industry that was once the most important in the world. About 100 years ago,there are
              Malay village that existed on the banks of the Kinta River. It is flanked by the Titiwangsa Range on the east and Mount Keledang on the west. In addition,
              the city is filled and surrounded by limestone hills that make this city a unique city and different from other cities in Malaysia.The name of the city of Ipoh
              comes from the name of a tree. These trees produce poisonous rubber or also known as upa. The poisonous rubber from the tree has many uses, it has been used by the Orang Asli to hunt animals.
              Poisonous rubber or upa is coated on the eyes of the chopsticks and also for self -defense as well as their families.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">When the British Resident, Sir Hugh Low was assigned to Perak, he mentioned in his writings around 1819 about poisonous rubber or upa obtained from the Ipoh Antiaris Toxicaria tree which was abundant at that time in the Kinta area, especially Kampong Parloh.
              Yet he referred to it as Epau of the English accent. In the map of Perak issued by the British colonizers in 1789, it is written Ipoh as Epau and Epu.
              Thus, it can be assumed that the city of Ipoh started around 1880s where at that time, it was just a small village of Orang Asli and Malay communities surrounded
              by forest and jungle.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In 1890, a wooden bridge was built across the Kinta River for the convenience of the public. Ipoh has grown to become one of the largest towns in Kinta District.
              With the advancement of tin ore companies, Ipoh became even more important. From then on, Ipoh continued to move from a tin mining village to a trade center that
              could attract many investors from outside. Ipoh Old Town sits on the west side of the Kinta River which flows through Ipoh. With its British-colonial shop lots,
              it looks similar to the Penangâ€™s Georgetown.</p>

            <h1><b>THE PEOPLE</b></h1>
            <div class="post">
              <p>The earliest population were Orang Asli community followed by the Malays. They are the pioneers and settlers of Ipoh.
              In 1879, there were a total of 4623 Malays living in the surroundings and areas close to the city of Ipoh. They have carried out tin
              mining activities by tradisional method which is panning and Siamese mining. Tin ore is brought by barges and canoes through the Kinta River.
              A few years later Kampung Parloh was transformed and became a center of trade and distribution of tin ore. Migrating foreigners such as
              the Chinese, Indians and Europeans began to concentrate in these areas and share with the Malays to run tin mining activities.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">It is believed that Dato 'Panglima Kinta's family first inhabited and settled and developed the city of Ipoh since the 16th century.
              According to the story of the elders, a captain from Sumatra arrived in the Kinta Valley and named himself Kulub Kinta using the title 'Yang Di Pertua Kinta'.
              Tun Tambak bin Maharaja Nara Wangsa Nyior Manis was the first Commander of Kinta. They own the entire Ipoh area and the Kampung Paloh area. The family has run
              the administration in these areas.</p>
