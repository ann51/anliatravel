            <p><span style="font-size:20px">Perak Tong is Ipoh's most famous cave temple and one of the city's most popular tourist attractions. It was founded in 1926 and has remained a significant religious site ever since.
              Even from the outside, the complex is spectacular; from the main road, you'll pass through a tiny garden with one artificial pool on each side before arriving in front of a massive temple with a red and white facade perched on an incredible limestone cliff. 
              You do not need to pay entry here, as in the other cave temples in Ipoh, although a donation is expected. Several vivid murals and frescoes representing Buddhist deities and Chinese calligraphy adorn the cave's interior.
              The centrepiece of the cave is a 15-meter-high gilded Buddha statue.
              If you have the time and energy, you can go through the temple and out to enjoy the greenery in the temple's garden as well as the magnificent views from a platform overlooking the city.
              The perspective is only around 300 steps away, but it is well worth the effort, even in the hot and humid weather.</p>
